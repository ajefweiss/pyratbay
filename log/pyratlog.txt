State summary:
--------------

To run (from run folder):
../src/pyrat.py -c config_pyrat00.cfg

Files:
------
pyrat.py:  Main code that call all sub-routines.
argum.py:  Process command-line arguments.
           Check inputs (files exist, physically acceptable values).
makesample.py:  makewn: make wavenumber sample for pyrat object:
                        p.wn, p.wnlow, p.wnhigh, p.wnstep, p.wnsize
readatm.py:  getkeywords: Read the keyword values from the atm file.
             getconstants: Read constant molecular values
             getprofiles: Read profile data table (rad, press, temp, abundances)
                          and calculate mean molec. mass and density.
             IGLdensity: Calculate pdensity using Ideal gas law.
readlinedb.py: readlinedb: read data bases headers, Iso names, masses, z, & c.
               TBD: Make checkrange to give only warnings if needed. 
               Next read line transitions info (in C!).

Issues:
-------
pt.msg cut's file paths in the middle of it.  It also doesn't obey linebreaks.

*****  Sun Jun 15 16:13:44 EDT 2014  *****

readlinedb.py:  Renamed readlinedb to readheader.  Wrote checkrange.
ptools:  Added warning function.  Adapted msg to print sentences (i.e. 
         separate by \n).  Set up call to readlinetransition.
pconstants.py:  Added maxnamelen and strfmt.
objects.py:  Structured the linetransition, databases and isotopes classes.


*****  Sun Jun 22 13:40:06 EDT 2014  *****

Current plan: read line transitions in Python, send to cpyrat.  Check times.

readlinedb.py: Wrote readlintransition function.
ptools.py: Implemented binary search for TLI file.
pconstants.py added tlireclen.


*****  Sun Jun 29 12:45:21 EDT 2014  *****

I will use the log-pressure array as the base for the layers sampling.
Changed pyrat.atm -> pyrat.atmf  (the input atmospheric file)
Now pyrat.atm will be the modeling atm.

object.py: Renamed pyrat.uin -> pyrat.user
makesample.py: Started writing makeradius, Do Hydrostatic-Equilibrium
               calculation to get radius as a 
               function of pressure, then interpolate to get pyrat.atm vals.

No pyrat work this week.  Put lineread up to date, for use with multiple
databases.


*****  Sun Jul 27 14:07:20 EDT 2014  *****

Upgrade pylineread from 4.0 to 5.0:
Main difference: 5.0 contains the molecule name for the isotope.

Moved /home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/pylineread/
to    /home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/pylineread/pylineread4.0

Created /home/patricio/ast/esp01/bart/pylineread/pylineread5.0
with new implementation.

Modification from lineread v4.0:

- Changed endianness 'magic' variable to 'endian', changed the value to
  'b' or 'l' to be less criptic.
- Change wavelength to wavenumber
- Added isotopic abundance ratio info in TLI file.
- Added nTransitions before writting the transition data.
- Changed order in which the transition data is written: instead of
  wl1, id1, el1, gf1, wl2, id2, ... gfN.   do:
  wl1, wl2, ..., wlN, id1, id2, ... gfN.

updated PS, HIT, and TiO.

VO data is in: /home/esp01/code/bart/data/opacities/VO/

Adapt pyrat to pylineread5.0:
- Edited: - readlinedb.py
          - ptools.py

Updatded pyrat to work with pylineread5.0.  On the way fixed a couple of bugs:
  - readlinedb.py: The very last step when I count the number of transitions
    to read.
  - binsearch: Handle case when the sequential search went beyond boundaries.

I had to hack a few things, but will do a real test once we have /usr/local/
working again.  I foresee no troubles between now and then.

Stored old code in: /home/patricio/ast/esp01/pyrat/develop/old/readlinedb4.0/

That's it for now, I can't get much further without scipy working.  Now I will
continue upgrading transit to make it efficient.


*****  Sun Aug 10 13:37:02 EDT 2014  *****

Updated makewavenumner in makesample.py to print a warning on the modified
last sample point.  Also, make the sample to stay inside the user-defined
boundary.

In makeradius, changed interpolation kind from 'cubic' to 'slinear' because
cubic was failing.  Implemented partition-function interpolation from
pyrat.lt.db to pyrat.iso.

Fixed bug in readline.py: I was adding db.niso to iso.niso for each isotope
rather than for each db.


*****  Sun Aug 17 14:53:42 EDT 2014  *****

argum.c:
  - Removed maxratio argument. Added Tmin and Tmax arguments.
  - Updated calls pt.exit -> pt.error.
  - Updated string formatting calls (% -> {} format).
  - Added Doppler/Lorentz widths handling.

objects.py:
  - Added voigt and extinction objects and related variables.

readatm.py:
  - Using new molecules.dat file.  Added molecule symbol and universal ID info.

extinction.py:
  - Started extinction calculation.  Implemented The Doppler, Lorentz-width
    limits calculation and calculate the arrays.

pyrat.py:
  - Added ex.voigt() step.

Next to do: Calculate the Voigt-profiles grid.


*****  Sun Aug 24 12:55:13 EDT 2014  *****

extinction.py:
  - Implemented the calcvoigt() function to calculate the Voigt profiles.  The
    function uses a modified version of transit's newprofile wrapper and
    voigt.c module (modified as header file voigt.h).

Created the vprofile.c C-extension module:
  - Python wrapper to calculate the Voigt profile (called from extinction's
    calcvoigt() function).

voigt.h:
  - Copied and modified file from the transit project.

argum.py:
  - Renamed LDthresh to DLratio.
